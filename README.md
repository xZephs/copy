Geanology request from a US citizen

The purpose of the Genealogy Records Request system is to provide an interface for a United States citizen to be able to request select forms and records on a deceased immigrant by inputting both their information and the information of the immigrant in question. This interface will eventually be web-based for ease of access, and will provide an email response to each user regarding the validity of the information they put in and, if all checks and verifications pass, the applicant will also receive the forms they requested of the immigrant.
